Title: An Introduction to Arrays in Programming

Introduction:
Arrays are fundamental data structures in programming that allow us to store and manipulate collections of elements. They provide a convenient way to organize and access data efficiently. In this blog post, we will explore the concept of arrays, their characteristics, and their applications in various programming languages.

What is an Array?
An array is a fixed-size, contiguous block of memory that can hold a collection of elements of the same data type. Each element in the array is identified by its index, which represents its position within the array. Arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0, the second element is at index 1, and so on.

Declaration and Initialization:
Arrays are declared using a specific syntax depending on the programming language
